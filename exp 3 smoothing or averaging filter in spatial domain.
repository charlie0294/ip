Aim: To Implement smoothing or averaging filter in spatial domain.
Objective: To Implement smoothing or averaging filter in spatial domain.
Tools Required: MATLAB R2015a
Commands used:
imread('trees.tif') → Reads an image file into MATLAB.
imshow(I) → Displays the original image.
title('original image') → Adds a title to the displayed image.
ones(3,3)/9 → Creates a 3×3 averaging filter (box filter) where each value is 1/9. This is used
for smoothing an image.
imfilter(I, f, 'circular') → Applies the smoothing filter f to the image I. The 'circular' option
ensures circular padding (pixels wrap around the edges).
subplot(2,2,1) → Divides the figure into a 2×2 grid and selects the first subplot for displaying
the original image.
subplot(2,2,2) → Selects the second subplot for displaying the smoothed image.
imshow(h) → Displays the filtered (smoothed) image.
title('averaged image') → Adds a title to the smoothed image.
Theory: Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image mask or filters will be
denied. The general process of convolution and correlation will be introduced via an example.
Also smoothing linear filters such as box and weighted average filters will be introduced.
In statistic and image processing, to smooth a data set is to create an approximating function
that attempts to capture important patterns in the data, while leaving out noise or other inescale structures/rapid phenomena. In smoothing, the data points of a signal are modified so
individual points (presumably because of noise) are reduced, and points that are lower than the
adjacent points are increased leading to a smoother signal. Smoothing may be used in two
important ways that can aid in data analysis by being able to extract more information from the
data as long as the assumption of smoothing is reasonable by being able to provide analyses
that are both lexible and robust different algorithms are used in smoothing.
Program:
% Program for implementation of smoothing or averaging filter in spatial domain
I=imread('trees.tif");
subplot(2,2,1);
imshow();
title('original image');
f=ones(3,3)/9;
h=imfilter(I,f,'circular);
subplot(2,2,2);
imshow(h);
title('averaged image');
Results:
Conclusion: Thus, we have performed the smoothing or averaging filter operation on the
Original Image and we get filtered Image.
