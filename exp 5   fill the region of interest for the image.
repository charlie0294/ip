Aim: To fill the region of interest for the image.
Objective: To fill the region of interest for the image
Tools Required: MATLAB R2015a
Commands used:
clc → Clears the command window.
close all → Closes all figure windows.
load trees → Loads the predefined 'trees' image dataset.
ind2gray(X, map) → Converts an indexed image (X, map) to a grayscale image.
imshow(I) → Displays the image.
title('original image') → Adds a title to the displayed image.
roi fill → This command is incorrect; possibly meant for region filling (needs correction).
imshow(I2) → Displays the processed image.
title('OUTPUT IMAGE') → Adds a title to the output image.
Theory: A region of interest (often abbreviated ROI), are samples within a data set identified
for a particular purpose. The concept of a ROI is commonly used in many application areas.
For example, in medical imaging, the boundaries of a tumour may be defined on an image or
in a volume, for the purpose of measuring its size. The endo cardinal border may be defined on
an image, perhaps during different phases of the cardiac cycle, for example, end-systole and
end-diastole, for the purpose of assessing cardiac function. In geographical information
systems (GIS), a ROI can be taken literally as a polygonal selection from a 2D map. In
computer vision and optical character recognition, the ROI defines the borders of an object
under consideration. In many applications, symbolic (textual) labels are added to a ROI, to
describe its content in a compact manner. Within a ROI may lie individual points of interest
(POIs).
Program:
% Program for ROI
clc;
close all;
load trees
1-ind2gray(X,map);
imshow(1)
title('original image');
12=roi ill;
imshow(12)
title('OUTPUT IMAGE);
Results:
Original Image
Output Image
Conclusion: Thus, we have detected the edges in the Original Image.
