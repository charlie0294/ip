Aim: To fill the region of interest of the image.
Tools Required: MATLAB R2015a
Commands used:
clc; → Clears the command window.
close all; → Closes all figure windows.
load trees; → Loads the predefined trees image.
imshow(X, map); → Displays the image using its colormap.
title('Original Image'); → Adds a title to the displayed image.
fprintf(...); → Prints a message in the command window.
roi_mask = roipoly(); → Allows the user to select a region of interest (ROI), returning a binary
mask.
filled_image(roi_mask) = 255; → Fills the selected region with white (255).
figure; → Opens a new figure window.
subplot(1,2,1); → Creates a subplot (1st position in a 1×2 grid).
subplot(1,2,2); → Creates another subplot (2nd position).
imshow(filled_image, map); → Displays the modified image.
title('Image with Filled Region of Interest'); → Adds a title to the second image.
Theory: A region of interest (often abbreviated ROI), are samples within a data set identified
for a particular purpose. The concept of a ROI is commonly used in many applications areas.
For example, in medical imaging, the boundaries of a tumor may be defined on an image,
perhaps during different phases of the cardiac cycle, for example, end-systole and end-diastole,
for the purpose of assessing cardiac function. In geographical information systems i.e GIS, a
ROI can be taken literally as a polygonal selection from a 2D map. In computer vision and
optical character recognition, the ROI defines the borders of an object under consideration.
Within a ROI may lie individual points of interests called POIs.
Use ROIFILL to fill in a specified polygon in an image. ROIFILL smoothly interpolates inward
from the pixel values on the boundary of the polygon by solving Laplace's equation. ROIFILL
can be used, for example, to erase objects in an image.
J = ROIFILL creates an interactive polygon tool, associated with the image displayed in the
current figure, called the target image. You place the tool interactively, using the mouse to
specify the vertices of the polygon. Double-click to add a final vertex to the polygon and close
the polygon. Right-click to close the polygon without adding a vertex. You can adjust the
position of the polygon and individual vertices in the polygon by clicking and dragging. To
delete the polygon, press Backspace, Escape or Delete, or choose the Cancel option from the
context menu. If the polygon is deleted, all return values are set to empty. After positioning and
sizing the polygon, fill the region by either double-clicking over the polygon or choosing Fill
Area from the tool's context menu. ROIFILL returns J, a version of the image with the region
filled.
J = ROIFILL (1) displays the image I and creates an interactive polygon tool associated with
that image.
J = ROIFILL (I,G,B) fills the polygon specified by C and R, which are equal-length vectors
containing the rou-column coordinates of the pixels on vertices of the polygon. The kith vertex
in the pixel (R(k)),C(k)).
Program:
clc;
closeall;
loadtrees;
imshow(X,map);
title('OriginalImage');
fprintf('Select the region of interest using roipoly.\n');
roi_mask = roipoly(); % Returns a binary mask of the selected region filled_image = X;
filled_image (roi_mask) = 255; % Fill the selected region with white figure; subplot(1,2,1);
imshow(X,map);
title('OriginalImage');
subplot(1,2,2);
imshow(filled_image,map);
title('Image with Filled Region of Interest');
Results:
Conclusion: Thus, we have filled the interested region in the original image.
