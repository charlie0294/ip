Aim: To study the Image Processing concept.
Objective: To study the Image Processing concept.
Tools Required: MATLAB R2015a
Commands used:
imread → Loads an image.
imcomplement → Computes the negative of an image.
imshow → Displays an image.
figure → Opens a new window for displaying an image.
imadjust → Adjusts image contrast based on intensity mapping.
Theory: Digital images play an important role both in daily life applications as well as in the
areas of research technology. Digital image processing refers to the manipulation of an image
using a processor. The different elements of an image processing system include Image
acquisition, image storage, image processing and display.
An image is a two-dimensional function that represents a message of sum characteristics cs
such as brightness or color of the viewed scene in the first MATLAB program. The command
used from MATLAB is complement.
Program:
% Program to study the image processing concept
I=imread(pout.tif);
J=imcomplement(I),
figure.imshow(I)
figure.imshow(J)
K=imadjust(I, [0,0.4],[05,1])
figure.imshow(K)
Results:
Original Image
Complement Image
Conclusion: Thus, we have studied how to obtain a complement image from
the original image.
