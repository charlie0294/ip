Aim: Program for edge detection algorithm.
Objective: Program for edge detection algorithm
Tools required: MATLAB R2015a
Commands used:
imread('coins.png') → Reads the input image.
imshow(I) → Displays the image.
title('...') → Adds a title to the displayed image.
ones(5,5)/25 → Creates a 5×5 averaging filter (smoothing filter).
imfilter(I, h) → Applies the filter to the image.
edge(b, 'sobel') → Detects edges using the Sobel operator.
edge(b, 'prewitt') → Detects edges using the Prewitt operator.
edge(b, 'roberts') → Detects edges using the Roberts operator.
edge(b, 'canny') → Detects edges using the Canny operator.
figure, imshow(...) → Displays each processed image in a separate window.
Theory: The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi- stage
algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in
1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the
technique works.
The Process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to 5 different steps:
1. Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise.
2. Find the intensity gradients of the image.
3. Apply non-maximum suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection.
4. Apply double threshold to determine potential edges.
5. Track edges by hypothesis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges
that are weak and not connected to strong edges.
