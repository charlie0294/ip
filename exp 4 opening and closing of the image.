Aim: Program for opening and closing of the image.
Objective: Program for opening and closing of the image.
Tools Required: MATLAB R2015a
Commands used:
imread('coins.png') → Reads the input image.
strel('square', 20) → Creates a 20×20 square structuring element.
imopen(f, se) → Performs morphological opening on the image.
imclose(f, se) → Performs morphological closing on the image.
imclose(fo, se) → Performs closing on the opened image.
figure, imshow(...) → Displays images in separate figure windows.
title('...') → Adds titles to the images.
Theory: In mathematical morphology, opening is the dilation of the erosion of a set by a
structuring elements B:
Together with closing, the opening serves in computer vision and image processing as a basic
workhorse of morphological noise removal. Opening removes small objects from the
foreground (usually taken as the bright pixels) of an image, placing them in the background,
while closing removes small holes in the foreground, changing small islands of background
into foreground. These techniques can also be used to find specific shapes in an image. Opening
can be used to find things into which a specific structuring element can it (edges, corners, ...).
In mathematical morphology, the closing of a set (binary image) A by a structuring element B
is the erosion of the dilation of that set. In image processing, closing is, together with opening,
the basic workhorse of morphological image removal. Opening removes small objects, while
closing removes small holes.
Program:
f-imread(coins.png');
se=strel('square',20);
fo=imopen(f,se);
igure,imshow(f)
title('input image'); igure,imshow(fo)
title('opening of input image');
fc=imclose(f,se);
figure,imshow(fc)
title('opening of input image');
foc=imclose(fo,se);
igure,imshow(foc)
title('closing of opened input image');
Results:
Conclusion: Thus, we have obtained the opened image and closed image from the Original
Image.
